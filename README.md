| [Homebrew][] | Manages applications, system-wide binaries, and vscode plugins. (Including [Mise][] and [Stow][]). |

| [Stow][]     | Symlinks the dotfiles, so it's easy to setup and maintain this repository.                         |

# Configuration

If you want to use this repository as the template of your own environment, you
should create a [fork](https://github.com/balintant/dotfiles/fork) and update
the configuration as you wish (starting with the files in the table below). This
way you will be able to pull my latest updates while maintaining your own,
personalised version of the configuration.
